# Equity Options Pricing Forecasting Analysis(BAC)

For my MATH 4051 (Computational Exploration & Data Generation) course, I used the following methodologies to predict the future option price:

**Methodology**

- Analyzed 52 years of historical price and volume data for BAC using Excel (Yahoo Finance)
- Estimated drift (expected return) and volatility to model stock price behavior
- Built a Monte Carlo simulation using inverse standard normal distributions to forecast prices over 63 future periods

**Results**

- Generated a distribution of simulated future prices across 500 trials
- Observed relatively narrow dispersion, indicating lower volatility compared to higher-risk equities
- Simulated price paths aligned with BAC’s long-term historical performance trends

**Conclusion**

- The simulation produced an estimated put option price at time 0 of 3.67101
- Results suggest Bank of America exhibits stable growth characteristics consistent with large-cap financial institutions
- Result aligns with S&P 500–level risk profiles; as a result, BAC has a lower-volatility equity relative to speculative stocks
